# Theory Gates

Decision gates that must pass before a diamond transitions between phases. Gates vary by scale level. Each gate has specific pass/fail criteria.

## Gate Structure

```
Gate Name
  Source: [theory/author]
  Applies to: [which transitions and scales]
  Pass criteria: [specific, measurable]
  Fail criteria: [what constitutes failure]
  Evidence required: [what artifacts demonstrate pass]

## Gate Definitions

### 1. Evidence Gate

**Source**: Torres (Continuous Discovery Habits), Gilad (Evidence-Guided)

**Applies to**: All transitions, all scales

| Scale | Pass Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| L0 | Market research, competitive analysis, stakeholder interviews documented | Assumptions stated without supporting data |
| L1 | Strategic evidence from multiple sources; quantified opportunity size | Strategy based on opinion or single data point |
| L2 | 5+ user interviews with triangulated findings; behavioral data | Fewer than 3 evidence sources; no triangulation |
| L3 | Prototype tested with users; measurable feedback collected | Solution chosen without user validation |
| L4 | Acceptance criteria defined with measurable outcomes | Vague or missing acceptance criteria |
| L5 | Test cases written before or alongside implementation | No tests; untested code |

**Evidence required**: Interview transcripts, analytics screenshots, research synthesis documents, test results.

### 2. Four Risks Gate

**Source**: Cagan (Inspired, Empowered)

**Applies to**: Define->Develop and Develop->Deliver transitions, L1-L4

All four risks must be assessed:

| Risk | Pass Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Value** | Evidence that users want/need this (not just stakeholder opinion) | No user validation; only internal demand |
| **Usability** | Users can figure out how to use it (tested, not assumed) | No usability testing; assumed "intuitive" |
| **Feasibility** | Engineering confirms buildable within constraints | No technical assessment; unknown dependencies |
| **Business Viability** | Aligns with business model, legal, ethical constraints | Conflicts with business constraints; legal risk unassessed |

**Evidence required**: User research findings, usability test results, technical spike outcomes, business model canvas or viability assessment.

### 3. JTBD Gate

**Source**: Christensen (Competing Against Luck)

**Applies to**: Discover->Define and Define->Develop, L1-L3

| Scale | Pass Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| L1 | Strategic jobs identified with all 3 dimensions | Jobs described only functionally |
| L2 | Opportunity-level jobs mapped from research data | Jobs assumed without research |
| L3 | Solution explicitly addresses functional, emotional, and social dimensions | Solution addresses only functional job |

**Evidence required**: JTBD statements with all three dimensions (functional, emotional, social), linked to interview data.

### 4. Cynefin Gate

**Source**: Snowden (Cynefin framework)

**Applies to**: Define->Develop, all scales

| Pass Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|--------------|---------------|
| Problem classified into a Cynefin domain | No classification attempted |
| Method chosen matches the domain (see cynefin-routing.md) | Complex problem treated as Clear (best practice applied to emergent situation) |
| If Complex, experiments designed with clear learning goals | Attempting to plan/predict outcomes in complex domain |

**Evidence required**: Cynefin classification document with rationale, method selection justification.

### 5. Bias Gate

**Source**: Shotton (The Choice Factory), Kahneman (Thinking, Fast and Slow)

**Applies to**: All transitions, all scales

| Pass Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|--------------|---------------|
| cognitive-biases.md checklist reviewed for current stage | No bias review conducted |
| Potential biases identified and mitigation documented | Known biases present but unacknowledged |
| Disconfirming evidence actively sought | Only confirming evidence collected |
| Agent's own biases examined (see cognitive-biases.md agent section) | Agent assumes objectivity |

**Evidence required**: Completed bias checklist, documented mitigation actions.

### 6. Security Gate

**Source**: OWASP, STRIDE

**Applies to**: Develop->Deliver and Deliver->Complete, L3-L5

| Scale | Pass Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| L3 | STRIDE threat model completed; security architecture reviewed | No threat analysis |
| L4 | OWASP Top 10 addressed; input validation; auth/authz verified | Known vulnerability unaddressed |
| L5 | Code-level security checks passing; no hardcoded secrets; dependencies scanned | Security scan findings ignored |

**Evidence required**: STRIDE analysis, security review checklist, dependency scan results, SAST/DAST results.

### 7. Privacy Gate

**Source**: GDPR, Privacy by Design (Cavoukian)

**Applies to**: Define->Develop and Develop->Deliver, L2-L4

| Scale | Pass Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| L2 | Data subjects identified; purpose limitation defined | Collecting data without defined purpose |
| L3 | DPIA completed for high-risk processing; data minimization applied | Processing PII without impact assessment |
| L4 | Consent mechanisms implemented; data retention defined; right to deletion supported | No consent flow; unlimited retention |

**Evidence required**: Data flow diagram, DPIA document, consent mechanism design, retention policy.

### 8. BVSSH Gate

**Source**: Smart (Sooner Safer Happier)

**Applies to**: Deliver->Complete, all scales

All five dimensions must be assessed:

| Dimension | Pass Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Better** | Quality metrics stable or improved | Quality degraded; tech debt increased without plan |
| **Value** | Measurable user/business value delivered or validated | No measurable outcome; vanity metrics only |
| **Sooner** | Lead time maintained or reduced; no unnecessary delays | Lead time increased; batch size too large |
| **Safer** | Risk reduced; compliance maintained; no new vulnerabilities | New risks introduced without mitigation |
| **Happier** | Team sustainability maintained; no burnout indicators | Unsustainable pace; team morale concerns |

**Evidence required**: Metrics dashboard, team health check, DORA metrics comparison.

### 9. Service Quality Gate

**Source**: Downe (Good Services)

**Applies to**: Develop->Deliver and Deliver->Complete, L2-L4

| Pass Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|--------------|---------------|
| Service evaluated against all 15 Downe principles | No service design review |
| No dead ends in user journeys | Users can get stuck with no next action |
| Accessible to all users equally | Accessibility not tested |
| Minimum possible steps to complete the outcome | Unnecessary steps in the flow |

**Evidence required**: Completed service-check skill output, user journey map, accessibility audit.

### 10. DORA Gate

**Source**: Forsgren (Accelerate)

**Applies to**: Deliver->Complete, L3-L5

| Pass Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|--------------|---------------|
| Deployment frequency maintained or improved | Deployments less frequent than baseline |
| Lead time for changes within target | Lead time increased beyond target |
| Change failure rate within target | Failure rate exceeds 15% |
| MTTR within target | Recovery time exceeds target |

**Evidence required**: DORA metrics dashboard, deployment logs, incident records.

### 11. Corrections Gate

**Source**: Mycelium (internal learning loop)

**Applies to**: All transitions, all scales

| Pass Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|--------------|---------------|
| corrections.md reviewed before work began | Corrections not consulted |
| No previously-documented mistakes repeated | Known mistake pattern detected |
| Any new mistakes documented with prevention strategy | Mistakes occurred but not logged |

**Evidence required**: Timestamp of corrections.md review, new entries if applicable.
