# Delivery Domain - Agent Behavior

## Purpose

Deliver validated solutions with engineering excellence, safety, and continuous learning. Every line of code should be intentional, tested, secure, and accessible.

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before writing any code:

1. **Read corrections.md** -- learn from past mistakes before repeating them.
2. **Run preflight skill** -- validate that prerequisites are met.
3. **Verify acceptance criteria** -- if criteria are ambiguous, clarify before coding.
4. **Confirm smallest vertical slice** -- what is the thinnest end-to-end slice that delivers value? Build that first.
5. **Check Cynefin domain** -- is this a clear, complicated, or complex problem? Method depends on domain.
6. **Review relevant patterns.md entries** -- reuse what has worked before.

## Engineering Principles

Apply consistently. See `engineering-principles.md` for full details.

| Principle | Summary |
|-----------|---------|
| **DRY** | Don't Repeat Yourself. Single source of truth for every piece of knowledge. |
| **KISS** | Keep It Simple. Simplest solution that meets the need. |
| **YAGNI** | You Aren't Gonna Need It. Don't build for speculative future needs. |
| **SoC** | Separation of Concerns. Each module has one reason to change. |
| **SOLID** | SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP -- the five principles of object-oriented design. |
| **LoD** | Law of Demeter. Talk only to immediate friends. |
| **Clean Code** | Readable, intention-revealing, well-named, small functions. |

## Testing Pyramid

Target distribution:

```
        /  E2E  \          5-10%  -- Critical user journeys only
       / Integr. \        15-20% -- API contracts, DB, external services
      /   Unit    \       70-80% -- Pure logic, edge cases, fast feedback
```

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit tests**: Write for every public function. Cover happy path, edge cases, error cases.
- **Integration tests**: Verify component boundaries, API contracts, database interactions.
- **E2E tests**: Cover critical user journeys. Keep minimal -- they are slow and brittle.
- **Property-based tests**: Use for functions with wide input domains. Test invariants, not examples.
- **Security tests**: Input validation, auth flows, injection vectors. See OWASP testing guide.
- **Accessibility tests**: Automated a11y checks in CI. Manual screen reader testing for key flows.

### TDD Practice

Write tests alongside code, not after:

1. Write a failing test that describes the desired behavior.
2. Write the minimum code to make it pass.
3. Refactor while keeping tests green.
4. Repeat.

## Security (OWASP)

Apply at every stage of delivery:

- **Input validation**: Validate all input on the server side. Allowlist over denylist. Validate type, length, range, format.
- **Output encoding**: Encode output based on context (HTML, JS, URL, CSS). Prevent XSS.
- **Parameterized queries**: Never concatenate user input into queries. Use parameterized/prepared statements.
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor where possible. Secure password storage (bcrypt/argon2). Session timeout.
- **Session management**: Generate new session ID on login. Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies. Invalidate on logout.
- **Secrets management**: Never hardcode secrets. Use environment variables or a secrets manager. Rotate regularly. Never log secrets.
- **Dependency scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI. Pin dependency versions. Review before updating.
- **HTTPS everywhere**: TLS for all connections. HSTS headers. Certificate management.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Non-negotiable baseline:

- **Semantic HTML**: Use correct elements (nav, main, article, button, etc.). Headings in order.
- **ARIA**: Use ARIA attributes only when semantic HTML is insufficient. Prefer native semantics.
- **Keyboard navigation**: All interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard. Visible focus indicators.
- **Color contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text. Never use color as the only indicator.
- **Screen reader support**: Meaningful alt text. Aria-labels. Live regions for dynamic content.
- **Motion**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion. No auto-playing animations.
- **Forms**: Associated labels. Error messages linked to fields. Clear instructions.

## Agile/DevOps Practices

- **Trunk-based development**: Short-lived feature branches (< 1 day ideally). Merge to main frequently.
- **Small batches**: Each commit should be deployable. If it isn't, the batch is too large.
- **WIP limits**: Maximum 1 item in progress per developer. Finish before starting.
- **CI/CD**: Automated build, test, lint, security scan on every push. Deployment pipeline to staging/production.
- **Progressive rollout**: Feature flags, canary deployments, percentage rollouts. Never big-bang releases.
- **Automated rollback**: If health checks fail post-deploy, roll back automatically. Mean time to recovery over mean time between failures.
- **Continuous monitoring**: Dashboards, alerts, SLOs. Know when something breaks before users report it.

## Reflexion Loop

Self-correcting implementation pattern (max 3 iterations):

```
1. IMPLEMENT -- Write code according to spec
2. VALIDATE  -- Run tests, linting, type checks, security scans
3. CRITIQUE  -- Review own output for:
                - Engineering principle violations
                - Missing edge cases
                - Security gaps
                - Accessibility issues
                - Unnecessary complexity
4. RETRY     -- If issues found, fix and return to step 2
               If 3 iterations reached, escalate for review
```

Each iteration must show measurable improvement. If the same issue recurs, investigate root cause.

## Definition of Done

A feature/story is done when ALL of the following are true:

- [ ] Acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Code reviewed (or self-reviewed with checklist)
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing (where applicable)
- [ ] No linting errors or warnings
- [ ] No type errors
- [ ] Security scan clean (no high/critical findings)
- [ ] Accessibility audit passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (API docs, README if needed)
- [ ] Performance acceptable (no regressions)
- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting configured
- [ ] corrections.md reviewed (no repeated mistakes)
- [ ] Deployed to staging and smoke tested
- [ ] BVSSH check passed

## DORA Metrics Tracking

Track and optimize the four key metrics (Forsgren):

- **Deployment Frequency**: How often code reaches production. Target: on-demand (multiple times per day).
- **Lead Time for Changes**: Time from commit to production. Target: less than one hour.
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing failure. Target: 0-15%.
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: Time to restore service after failure. Target: less than one hour.

## Observability

Build observable systems from the start:

- **Structured logging**: JSON format. Include correlation IDs, timestamps, severity levels. Log decisions, not just events.
- **Metrics**: Track request rate, error rate, duration (RED). Track utilization, saturation, errors (USE). Business metrics too.
- **Error tracking**: Capture stack traces, context, affected users. Deduplicate. Alert on new error types.
- **Distributed tracing**: Trace requests across service boundaries. Identify bottlenecks.

## JiT (Just-in-Time) Tooling

Auto-detect the technology stack and apply appropriate tooling:

- Detect language, framework, package manager, test runner, linter, formatter.
- Apply language-idiomatic practices (don't force Python patterns on Go, etc.).
- Use existing project configuration before introducing new tools.
- Prefer the project's established patterns over "better" alternatives.
- Be language-agnostic in principles, language-specific in implementation.

## Post-Delivery

After every delivery cycle:

1. **Update delivery-journal.md** -- What was delivered, what was learned, what surprised us.
2. **Update patterns.md** -- New patterns discovered, existing patterns refined.
3. **Run retrospective** -- What went well, what didn't, what to change.
4. **BVSSH check** -- Is this delivery Better Value Sooner Safer Happier? If not, why?
5. **Review DORA metrics** -- Did this cycle improve or degrade our metrics?
6. **Update corrections.md** -- Any mistakes made? Document for future prevention.
